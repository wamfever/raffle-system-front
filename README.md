# Getting Started with Raffle World Website Interface

This is a sample front to support some basic mechanisms and interactions with MetaMask and deployed smart contract, the RaffleWorld upgradable & ownable contract.

## Connections & interfaces

As mentioned before, the frontend interacts with: 
* MetaMask
* [RaffleWorld](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xD369a1c50E04D16fD04654654F70b4E9C36BFA82) contract deployed on Rinkeby

## How to
The test setup uses the MetaMask integration from a test account of Rinkeby Network. In order to simulate the exact same behaviour, please conenct Metamask to your Rinkeby Network Account.
```shell
git clone
npm i
npm start
```
